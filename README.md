## :arrow_down: Download

- [Download the latest installer](https://github.com/NullDev/Kute/releases/latest/download/kute-setup-x86_64.msi)
- [Download the portable zip](https://github.com/NullDev/Kute/releases/latest/download/kute-x86_64-portable.zip) (unpack anywhere and start `kute.exe`. Settings stay in `Documents\kute`, small updates still apply by themselves, a new client version opens the download page instead of installing)

## :sparkles: About

Kute is a high-performance Krunker client designed to enhance your gaming experience with features like uncapped FPS, optimized performance tweaks, custom scripts, and more. It runs on its own bundled Chromium (CEF) and provides a seamless, feature-rich environment for both casual and competitive players. Brought to you by <code>[cute]</code>, and the same guy who co-developed [idkr](https://github.com/idkr-client/idkr) and contributed to [glorp](https://github.com/slavcp/glorp).

> [!WARNING]
> This client uses patched CEF with Raw Input, which means mouse input is native: every bit of movement reaches the game, more accurately than on any other client. If you are used to playing on other clients, it might take a bit of time to get used to it.

## :star: Features

- [x] Runs on its own bundled Chromium (CEF), no browser or runtime install needed
  - [x] Patched CEF: fixes the aim freeze and the GPU bottleneck stutter of uncapped clients
  - [x] Every Chromium patch is a switch in the Engine settings, so any of them can be turned off on a PC where it does not help
  - [x] Fix Audio Stutters (optional): sound that cuts out at high FPS costs the audio thread about 60 % less
- [x] Uncapped FPS with a DXGI present hook: waitable flip swapchain, frame pacing and a present FPS counter
- [x] Exact FPS limiter inside Chromium's compositor (our patch): frames start on a fixed grid and reach the screen as soon as they are drawn
- [x] **Proper** Raw input (100%)
- [x] Increased performance tweaks (chromium & CEF flags, game settings, system optimizations)
- [x] Auto-Detect Best Settings: Client benchmarks your PC and automatically selects the optimal settings for performance and stability. Can be reverted at any time
- [x] Disable all non-performance features: one switch turns off every cosmetic feature and hides its settings, switch it back and your choices return
- [x] Laptops with two graphics chips are recognized: Kute picks the fast one in Windows' graphics settings once, and starts without the swapchain hook there
- [x] Laptop Power Boost (optional): a plugged in laptop runs on Windows' Best performance mode while Kute is open, and gets its own mode back after
- [x] NVIDIA driver caps lifted for Kute only: its own driver profile
- [x] Selectable graphics backend (ANGLE: D3D11, D3D11on12, OpenGL, Vulkan) and color profile
- [x] Optimized URL blocklist (only ~50 entries, fully customizable), custom Chromium flags
- [x] Resource swapper with an in-client manager: shows which game files your swaps replace, drag'n'drop & built-in editor
- [x] Classic menu (optional): the Season 9 menu layout, with every new Season 10 button and feature still in it
- [x] Cleaner menu (optional): hides the store ad, live streams, featured maps, the "Popular Now" row and other promos in the menu, in the regular and the classic menu. The logo, every button and the match info stay
- [x] Custom CSS with a syntax highlighted editor and live preview, always applied on top of Krunker's own styles
- [x] Motion blur (optional): a slight blur while you turn the camera, the HUD stays sharp
- [x] Custom sky (optional): a built-in preset, your own color gradient or your own image as the sky of every map
- [x] All settings togglable
- [x] Export and import Kute's settings (client settings, HUD positions, matchmaker filters, hotkeys) as one file, for a second PC or a fresh install
- [x] Battle pass claim-all
- [x] Userscripts (Crankshaft and idkr formats) with an in-client manager: live on/off, script settings, a built-in editor, drag and drop
- [x] Mod compatibility: mods, lobby and invite links open in the game window instead of a second one that would end your match
- [x] OBS capture plugin (shared texture game capture plus a dedicated audio window)
- [x] Officially supported by Medal.tv
- [x] Encrypted Account Manager
- [x] Queue ranked without the game open
- [x] Better ranked with ELO system
- [x] Find out your real ping to the servers
- [x] Matchmaker: F6 joins the lowest ping lobby that fits your filters (region, mode, map, players, time left)
- [x] Better chat
- [x] Hardpoint enemy counter
- [x] Nuke counter: your career nuke total in game, with an optional goal
- [x] Keystrokes: your bound movement keys and mouse in the HUD, lit while pressed, with a ring that shows which way the mouse moves
- [x] HUD editor: drag, resize and hide every in-game HUD element and the menu timer, snapping included
- [x] Rank progress
- [x] Clan colors
- [x] Kute badge (one setting turns off every Kute online feature, nothing is sent then)
- [x] Kute icons: our own counter, ammo, hitmarker, reticle and scope icons, each one optional, without touching your settings
- [x] Discord Rich Presence
- [x] CPU throttler (a last resort, see below)
- [x] Autoupdater with a download progress window, plus changelogs
- [x] Rebindable kute hotkeys
- [x] Matchmaker
- [x] Spotify overlay - by [@Liamoulee](https://github.com/Liamoulee)
- [ ] Skin Swapper (coming soon, maybe)
- [ ] BetterKDR™️ (coming soon)
- [ ] Bloomberg-style trading terminal & market analysis (coming soon)
- [x] and more...

## :question: FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>My game stutters.</b></summary>
<br>

Run **Auto-Detect Best Settings** (General settings). It tests the client and plays a private test match by itself (don't touch mouse or keyboard for about two minutes), and only keeps what measurably runs better on your PC (it needs a Krunker account). Leave CPU Throttling at 1. Still stuttering? Open Auto-Detect's Advanced view, copy the report and [open an issue](https://github.com/NullDev/Kute/issues/choose).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I can't aim / my aim feels different.</b></summary>
<br>

Kute uses pure raw input: your mouse's movement goes straight to the game, without Windows pointer acceleration, and none of it gets lost, not even the movement in the same instant as a click or a scroll. No other client passes every bit of it through. It is more accurate, and exactly because of that it can feel different for a few rounds if your aim is used to another client. Give it some time before you change your sensitivity.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My FPS is lower than in other clients, but Kute feels smoother.</b></summary>
<br>

Uncapped, other clients count every frame the game computes, including frames that never reach your screen: they pile up behind the GPU and get replaced before they are shown. That makes a big number, but those extra frames are only extra load and extra input lag. Kute's swap chain hook and patched Chromium let the game run just one frame ahead, so it only computes frames that actually get shown, and the **Present FPS Counter** (Interface settings) shows the frames that reach your screen. A lower number that is real, instead of a higher one that is not.

## :handshake: Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request. In short:

- Issues labeled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/NullDev/Kute/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) are the best place to start.
- Ask in an issue before working on a new feature. There is no guarantee it gets merged.
- All code must be audited and tested by a human. No AI generated or vibe coded PRs.
- Code must never make performance worse. Anything that costs performance goes behind a setting that is off by default, or does not get added.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Standalone forks may **not** use the [kute.lol](https://kute.lol) website or its API. If you ship your own client based on Kute, point it at your own server.
